# 👋 Hello, I'm Andrew

I'm a developer who values **data-driven design**, **flat logic structures**, and **mathematical and statistical computation**. I tend to work close to the metal—whether in **Rust**, **Lua**, or **R**, or **Lean4**, and I enjoy crafting code that’s minimal, maintainable, and intentional.

## 🧰 Tech Preferences

| Focus Area | Tools & Languages |
| --- | --- |
| Systems Programming | Rust |
| Scripting & UIs | Lua |
| Proof & Logic | Lean4 |
| Meta-Programming | Lisp, meta-macros |
| Flexible Runtime Design | Loaders (I/O logic scaffolds), meta-dispatch |
| Statistics and data-entry | SQL, R, Rust (Can do Python, but I avoid it) |
| Philosophy | D.R.Y. , K.I.S.S. |

## 🔍 What Drives Me

- **Data-Driven Code**: Let structured data drive behavior, not layered conditionals.
- **Minimal Nesting**: Prefer flat tables and declarative logic.
- **Symbolic Systems**: Explore math, biotech, and computation/statistical models.
- **Custom Tooling**: I build my own editors, shells, and automation pipelines.
- **Precision**: Strive for correctness, clarity, low overhead, and future proof code.

## 🚧 Projects

I'm actively working on several projects. They'll be public when they're ready. Until then, feel free to reach out if our interests overlap.
